### Custom Date/Time

4. The tab will be closed and reopened at your chosen time

### Keyboard Shortcuts

You can use the predefined keyboard shortcuts to quickly snooze tabs without opening the popup:

- `Shift+Command+1` (Mac) / `Shift+Ctrl+1` (Windows/Linux) - 4 hours
- `Shift+Command+2` (Mac) / `Shift+Ctrl+2` (Windows/Linux) - Tomorrow 9AM
- `Shift+Command+3` (Mac) / `Shift+Ctrl+3` (Windows/Linux) - One month

## How It Works

The extension uses Chrome's alarm API to schedule when tabs should be reopened. When you snooze a tab:

1. The tab's URL and title are saved to local storage
2. An alarm is created for the scheduled time
3. The tab is closed
4. When the alarm fires, the tab is reopened at the saved URL

### Persistent Scheduling

The extension includes robust persistence mechanisms to ensure your snoozed tabs are never lost:

- **Startup Recovery**: When the browser starts, the extension checks for any tabs that should have been opened during
  downtime
- **Periodic Checks**: Every 15 minutes, the extension verifies no tabs were missed
- **Alarm Persistence**: Uses Chrome's persistent alarm API to survive browser restarts
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging
- **Data Validation**: Validates stored tab data to prevent corruption

This means your snoozed tabs will reopen reliably even if:

- Your computer is turned off and back on
- The browser is closed and reopened
- The extension is updated or reinstalled
- There are temporary system issues
